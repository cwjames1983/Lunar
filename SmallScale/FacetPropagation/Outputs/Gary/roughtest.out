Reading in surface from file SurfaceFiles/trivial_64.dat
reading ascii surface...
This surface has 64 x 64 facets of size 0.2^2 m^2.
Creating a new surface, averaged over 1 steps of the previous surface, starting at 0, 0,  and concatenating the outer 0 facets:
The modified surface is 64x64, with total dimensions 12.6x12.6 m.
Not writing the modified surface to modded_trivial.dat
Reading data on shower tracks from TrackFiles/trivial_tracks.dat
There is 1 track in the track file.
The tracks are to be rotated by 0 degrees about the y-axis in the x-z plane, and rotated 0 degrees in the x-y plane from x towards y.
height at X=6.2, Y=6.2 is -10
The zero-point of the cascade is (0,0,-10), i.e. -10 below the local surface.
Track 0 p0 = (6.3,6.3,-10)     p1 = (9.3,6.3,-10)
Tracks initialised!
The modded tracks have been written to modded_TrackFiles/trivial_tracks.dat
Refractive indices are 1.8 and 1.8 for the cascade / detection media respectively; the attenuation length at one GHz is 1.8e+11 m.

Performing initialisation (mostly of shortcuts)...
The memory required for facet initialisation is 2.66473 MB
The memory from basic initialisation is: 0.313015 MB
The memory required for facet initialisation is 2 MB
Frequencies are divided as follows:
    Division 0 with 1 frequencies.
    Division 1 with 1 frequencies.
    ....initialisation completed.
Beginning main computation loop: there will be 1 1 inner x-y loops, each over 1 tracks, and 2 separate frequency divisions, for a total number of 2 calls. Now, go get some coffee...
Currently looping facets for track 0.
