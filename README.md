# Lunar
A repository for programs related to the lunar Askaryan technique.

Currently included is the "SmallScale" codebase, designed to propagate coherent radiation from a finite number of particle tracks through a random rough surface to the far-field.

Utilities includes various useful files which may be used by multiple programs, including the RandomC code from www.agner.org/random/

This code requires the FFTW3 library to be installed on the system.
